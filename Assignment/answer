8)False

9)3

10) main difference between both of them is following
    1)tuple is immutable while list is mutable
    2)Tuples are heterogeneous data structures while list are homogeneous sequences.

Consider the following two data structures:
>>> import time
>>> time.localtime()
(2008, 2, 5, 11, 55, 34, 1, 36, 0)
>>> range(10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
The first one, a tuple, is a sequence in which position has semantic value. The first position is always a year.
This tuple functions as a lightweight record or struct.

The second one, a list, is a sequence where we may care about order, but where the individual values are functionally equivalent.

11)let's say we have list named S. if one want to access last element then S[-1]

12)it means that you are providing an index for which a list element does not exist.

E.g, if your list was [1, 2, 3, 4], and you asked for the element at index 5,
you would be well out of bounds and receive an error, as only elements 0 through 3 exist.

13)by using .join()  one can convert list into string.
list1 = ['1', '2', '3']
str1 = ''.join(list1)

14)using sort(list) method

17)"is" will return True if two variables point to the same object, ""==" if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.
